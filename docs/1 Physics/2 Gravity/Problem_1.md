\section{Gravitational Force}

Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects toward its center. The gravitational force between two masses is given by:

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( F \) = Gravitational force (N)
    \item \( G \) = Gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2\))
    \item \( m_1, m_2 \) = Masses of the objects (kg)
    \item \( r \) = Distance between the objects (m)
\end{itemize}

\section{Acceleration Due to Gravity (g)}

The acceleration experienced by an object due to Earth's gravity is approximately:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{R^2}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity on Earth (9.81 m/sÂ²)
    \item \( M \) = Mass of the Earth (\( 5.972 \times 10^{24} \) kg)
    \item \( R \) = Radius of the Earth (\( 6.371 \times 10^6 \) m)
\end{itemize}

\section{Free Fall Motion}

For an object in free fall (neglecting air resistance), the equations of motion are:

\[
v = v_0 + gt
\]

\[
y = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2g y
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( v_0 \) = Initial velocity (m/s)
    \item \( v \) = Final velocity (m/s)
    \item \( t \) = Time (s)
    \item \( y \) = Displacement (m)
\end{itemize}

\section{Orbital Motion and Escape Velocity}

The velocity needed for an object to stay in orbit around Earth is:

\[
v_{\text{orbit}} = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
\]

The **escape velocity**, which is the minimum speed needed to break free from Earth's gravitational pull, is:

\[
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
\]

For Earth, this is approximately **11.2 km/s**.
