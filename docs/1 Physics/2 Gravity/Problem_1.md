\section{Newton's Laws of Motion}

\subsection{First Law: Law of Inertia}
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

\[
F_{\text{net}} = 0 \Rightarrow \text{constant velocity}
\]

\subsection{Second Law: Law of Acceleration}
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

\[
F = m a
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( F \) = Net force (N)
    \item \( m \) = Mass (kg)
    \item \( a \) = Acceleration (m/s²)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Third Law: Action and Reaction}
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

\[
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
\]

\section{Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}

Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( F \) = Gravitational force (N)
    \item \( G \) = Gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2\))
    \item \( m_1, m_2 \) = Masses of the objects (kg)
    \item \( r \) = Distance between the objects (m)
\end{itemize}

\section{Example Calculation: Gravitational Force}
If two masses, \( m_1 = 5 \) kg and \( m_2 = 10 \) kg, are 2 meters apart, the gravitational force between them is:

\[
F = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{(5)(10)}{2^2}
\]

\[
F = 8.34 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N}
\]
