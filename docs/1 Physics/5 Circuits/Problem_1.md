# Problem 1
To solve the problem of calculating equivalent resistance using graph theory, we can leverage a systematic approach to simplify complex resistor networks by iteratively reducing the graph representation of the circuit. Let's break down both the algorithm and its implementation for solving this problem.

### **Algorithm Description for Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory**

We will focus on the following key steps in the algorithm:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the circuit as a graph where:
   - **Nodes (vertices)** correspond to the junctions in the circuit.
   - **Edges** represent resistors, with weights corresponding to their resistance values.

2. **Series and Parallel Connection Identification**:
   - **Series connection**: Two resistors are in series if they share a common node and have no other resistors connected between them.
   - **Parallel connection**: Two resistors are in parallel if they are connected to the same pair of nodes.
   
3. **Iterative Reduction**:
   - We reduce the graph by identifying series and parallel connections, applying the corresponding formulas:
     - **Series connection**: The total resistance \( R_{\text{total}} \) is simply the sum of individual resistances:
       \[
       R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n
       \]
     - **Parallel connection**: The total resistance \( R_{\text{total}} \) for resistors in parallel is given by:
       \[
       \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{R_n}
       \]
   - Once a reduction is done, the circuit graph shrinks, and we continue applying the reduction steps until the graph is reduced to a single node representing the equivalent resistance.

4. **Handling Nested Combinations**:
   - For circuits with nested combinations of series and parallel resistors, the algorithm iterates over the graph, identifies simple series or parallel connections, reduces them, and then repeats the process with the updated graph until only one equivalent resistance remains.

### **Pseudocode for the Algorithm**

```plaintext
1. Initialize the graph G with nodes (representing junctions) and edges (representing resistors with resistance values).
2. While the graph G has more than one node:
   a. Identify series connections:
      - For each edge in G, check if it forms a series connection (i.e., two resistors connected in series).
      - Combine the resistors in series by summing their resistances and updating the graph.
   
   b. Identify parallel connections:
      - For each pair of nodes, check if they have resistors in parallel (i.e., two resistors connected between the same pair of nodes).
      - Combine the resistors in parallel by applying the parallel resistance formula and update the graph.
   
   c. Repeat until the graph has only one node remaining.
   
3. Return the final equivalent resistance, which is the resistance value of the last edge in the reduced graph.
```

### **Explanation of the Algorithm**
- The algorithm iterates over the graph to find series and parallel combinations of resistors. For each identified combination, it reduces the circuit by replacing the combination with an equivalent resistor.
- **Series connections** are reduced by summing the resistances of the connected resistors.
- **Parallel connections** are reduced using the parallel formula, ensuring that the equivalent resistance is recalculated each time.
- The algorithm continues reducing the graph until it converges to a single node, which represents the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.

### **Handling Nested Configurations**
- Nested series and parallel combinations are handled by iteratively simplifying the graph. After each reduction, the graph is updated, and the algorithm rechecks the remaining circuit to identify any new possible series or parallel connections.

### **Full Implementation in Python (using NetworkX)**

```python
import networkx as nx

def calculate_equivalent_resistance(G):
    """
    Calculates the equivalent resistance of a circuit represented as a graph using series and parallel reductions.
    """
    while len(G.nodes) > 1:
        # Identify and reduce series connections
        for edge in list(G.edges(data=True)):
            u, v, data = edge
            R = data['resistance']
            
            # Check if this edge forms a series connection
            if len(list(G.neighbors(u))) == 2 and len(list(G.neighbors(v))) == 2:
                # Combine the resistors in series
                total_R = R + data['resistance']
                G.add_edge(u, v, resistance=total_R)
                G.remove_edge(u, v)
                break

        # Identify and reduce parallel connections
        for edge in list(G.edges(data=True)):
            u, v, data = edge
            R = data['resistance']
            
            # Check if two resistors are connected in parallel
            if len(list(G.neighbors(u))) == 1 and len(list(G.neighbors(v))) == 1:
                # Combine the resistors in parallel
                total_R = 1 / (1/R + 1/R)  # Assuming two resistors in parallel
                G.add_edge(u, v, resistance=total_R)
                G.remove_edge(u, v)
                break
                
    # Return the equivalent resistance
    return G.edges(data=True)[0][2]['resistance']

# Example usage:
G = nx.Graph()

# Adding nodes and edges to create a simple circuit (e.g., two resistors in series)
G.add_edge(0, 1, resistance=10)  # Resistor R1 = 10 ohms
G.add_edge(1, 2, resistance=20)  # Resistor R2 = 20 ohms

# Calculate equivalent resistance
print("Equivalent Resistance:", calculate_equivalent_resistance(G))
```

### **Testing and Examples**
- **Simple Series Connection**: For two resistors \( R_1 = 10 \, \Omega \) and \( R_2 = 20 \, \Omega \) in series, the equivalent resistance should be \( 30 \, \Omega \).
- **Parallel Connection**: For two resistors \( R_1 = 10 \, \Omega \) and \( R_2 = 20 \, \Omega \) in parallel, the equivalent resistance should be:
  \[
  R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{20}\right)} = 6.67 \, \Omega
  \]
  
### **Efficiency Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm iterates over the graph until only one node remains. The complexity of each iteration is proportional to the number of edges in the graph, \( O(E) \), where \( E \) is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is proportional to the number of nodes and edges in the graph, \( O(V + E) \), where \( V \) is the number of vertices.

The algorithm is efficient for typical circuit graphs, but for very large or dense graphs, optimizations (like more advanced graph traversal methods) might be necessary.
