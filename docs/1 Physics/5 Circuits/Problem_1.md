# Problem 1
This task involves calculating the equivalent resistance of an electrical circuit using graph theory. In graph-theoretical terms, a circuit is represented as a graph where each resistor is an edge, and each node represents a junction in the circuit.

For the simplified task, I will describe the algorithm in pseudocode, focusing on detecting series and parallel combinations of resistors in a graph and iteratively simplifying the graph until a single equivalent resistance is obtained.

### Option 1: Simplified Task â€“ Algorithm Description

#### Algorithm Overview:
1. **Identify Series and Parallel Connections**: 
   - **Series connection**: Resistors in series are connected end-to-end. The total resistance of resistors in series is the sum of individual resistances.
   - **Parallel connection**: Resistors in parallel share both endpoints, and the total resistance is found using the reciprocal sum formula: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \sum \frac{1}{R_i}
     \]

2. **Iteratively Reduce the Graph**:
   - We need to find and reduce series and parallel resistors until only one equivalent resistance remains.

3. **Handling Nested Combinations**:
   - In cases where the circuit has both series and parallel connections combined in complex configurations, the algorithm needs to recursively simplify parts of the graph.

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Initialize the Graph**: 
   - Represent the circuit as a graph where each edge has a weight corresponding to the resistor value.
   
2. **Detect and Simplify Series Connections**:
   - For each pair of nodes connected by a single edge (resistor), check if there are additional series connections. If so, sum the resistances and reduce the graph.
   
3. **Detect and Simplify Parallel Connections**:
   - For each set of nodes with multiple edges between them (parallel resistors), calculate the equivalent resistance using the reciprocal sum formula, and then reduce the graph.

4. **Repeat Until One Equivalent Resistance is Left**:
   - Keep applying the series and parallel reduction rules iteratively to simplify the graph until a single equivalent resistance remains.

#### Pseudocode:

```python
# Function to calculate equivalent resistance
def calculate_equivalent_resistance(circuit_graph):
    # Initialize the graph (resistances as edge weights)
    while len(circuit_graph.nodes) > 1:  # Repeat until only one node remains
        # Step 1: Detect and simplify series connections
        for each pair of connected nodes (u, v) in circuit_graph:
            if is_series_connection(u, v, circuit_graph):
                # Calculate series resistance
                R_series = sum_resistances(u, v, circuit_graph)
                # Simplify the graph by replacing series resistors with equivalent resistance
                simplify_series(u, v, R_series, circuit_graph)
        
        # Step 2: Detect and simplify parallel connections
        for each set of parallel resistors (u, v) in circuit_graph:
            if is_parallel_connection(u, v, circuit_graph):
                # Calculate parallel resistance
                R_parallel = calculate_parallel_resistance(u, v, circuit_graph)
                # Simplify the graph by replacing parallel resistors with equivalent resistance
                simplify_parallel(u, v, R_parallel, circuit_graph)

    # The final remaining node has the equivalent resistance
    return circuit_graph.get_node_resistance()

# Helper function to detect series connections
def is_series_connection(u, v, graph):
    # Check if the nodes are in series (connected in a linear fashion)
    return len(graph[u]) == 1 and len(graph[v]) == 1

# Helper function to sum resistances in series
def sum_resistances(u, v, graph):
    return graph[u][v] + graph[v][u]

# Helper function to simplify series connections
def simplify_series(u, v, R, graph):
    graph.remove_edge(u, v)
    graph.add_edge(u, v, R)

# Helper function to detect parallel connections
def is_parallel_connection(u, v, graph):
    # Check if the nodes have multiple edges (parallel resistors)
    return len(graph[u][v]) > 1

# Helper function to calculate parallel resistance
def calculate_parallel_resistance(u, v, graph):
    total_inverse = sum(1/graph[u][v] for edge in graph[u][v])
    return 1 / total_inverse

# Helper function to simplify parallel connections
def simplify_parallel(u, v, R, graph):
    # Replace the parallel resistors with the equivalent resistance
    graph.remove_edges(u, v)
    graph.add_edge(u, v, R)
```

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
1. **Graph Representation**: The circuit is represented as a graph where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors.
2. **Series and Parallel Detection**: The algorithm first detects series and parallel connections by checking the structure of the graph:
   - **Series**: Nodes are connected in sequence.
   - **Parallel**: Nodes share both endpoints with multiple resistors between them.
3. **Iterative Reduction**: It iterates through the graph, simplifying series and parallel connections one by one, until only one equivalent resistance remains.
4. **Handling Nested Combinations**: By repeatedly simplifying series and parallel combinations, the algorithm can handle complex, nested circuit configurations.

#### Efficiency Considerations:
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm's time complexity depends on the size of the graph and the number of series and parallel reductions required. Each reduction typically takes linear time, and the total number of reductions is proportional to the number of edges and nodes in the graph.
- **Graph Traversal**: Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to explore the graph for series and parallel connections efficiently.

#### Potential Improvements:
- **Cycle Detection**: In complex graphs with cycles, detecting and simplifying cycles could further optimize the solution.
- **Graph Libraries**: Using libraries like `networkx` in Python for graph manipulation can simplify handling of graph-related operations.

This algorithm provides a structured way to analyze and simplify electrical circuits using graph theory, offering an efficient approach to calculating equivalent resistance even in complex configurations.
