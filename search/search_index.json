It is analyzed as two independent motions: Horizontal motion \u2013 constant velocity (no horizontal acceleration if air resistance is ignored). Vertical motion \u2013 uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity. Equations of Projectile Motion Let: - \\( v_0 \\) = Initial velocity - \\( \\theta \\) = Launch angle - \\( g \\) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2) - \\( t \\) = Time 1. Horizontal Motion Velocity: $$ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ (Constant, since no horizontal acceleration) Displacement: $$ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ 2. Vertical Motion Velocity: $$ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Displacement: $$ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time to reach max height: $$ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ Maximum height: $$ h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} $$ 3. Time of Flight The total time the projectile is in the air: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ 4. Range (Horizontal Distance) The total horizontal distance traveled: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Key Points The trajectory is a parabola . The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. The optimal launch angle for maximum range is 45\u00b0 (without air resistance).","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"-","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-definition-equations","text":"Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, following a parabolic path .

These laws are fundamental principles in physics. 1st Law: Law of Inertia An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Mathematically: [ F_{\\text{net}} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{constant velocity} ] 2nd Law: Law of Acceleration The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. \\[ F = m a \\] Where: - \\( F \\) = Net force (N) - \\( m \\) = Mass (kg) - \\( a \\) = Acceleration (m/s\u00b2) 3rd Law: Action and Reaction For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
