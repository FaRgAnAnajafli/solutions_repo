\section{Newton's First Law: Law of Inertia}
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

\[
F_{\text{net}} = 0 \Rightarrow \text{constant velocity}
\]

\section{Newton's Second Law: Law of Acceleration}
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

\[
F = m a
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( F \) = Net force (N)
    \item \( m \) = Mass (kg)
    \item \( a \) = Acceleration (m/sÂ²)
\end{itemize}

\section{Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction}
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

\[
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
\]

\section{Example Calculation: Newton's Second Law}
If a 10 kg object is subjected to a force of 50 N, its acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{50}{10} = 5 \text{ m/s}^2
\]
