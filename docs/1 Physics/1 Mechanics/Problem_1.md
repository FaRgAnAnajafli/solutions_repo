# Problem 1

### **Projectile Motion: Detailed Explanation with Formulas**  

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object launched into the air, moving under the influence of gravity while following a curved **parabolic** trajectory. It is a combination of two independent motions:  

1. **Horizontal motion** (constant velocity, no acceleration).  
2. **Vertical motion** (accelerated motion due to gravity).  

---

## **1. Components of Initial Velocity**
When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \), it has two components:  

- **Horizontal velocity:**  
  \[
  v_x = v_0 \cos\theta
  \]
- **Vertical velocity:**  
  \[
  v_y = v_0 \sin\theta
  \]

At any time \( t \), the velocity components are:  
- **Horizontal velocity remains constant:**  
  \[
  v_x = v_0 \cos\theta
  \]
- **Vertical velocity changes due to gravity:**  
  \[
  v_y = v_0 \sin\theta - gt
  \]
  where \( g = 9.8 \, m/s^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity).

---

## **2. Time of Flight (\( T \))**
The total time the projectile spends in the air is determined by the time taken to reach the highest point and then fall back down:  
\[
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}
\]

---

## **3. Maximum Height (\( H \))**
The highest vertical position of the projectile is given by:  
\[
H = \frac{(v_0 \sin\theta)^2}{2g}
\]

---

## **4. Horizontal Range (\( R \))**
The total horizontal distance traveled by the projectile before hitting the ground is:  
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
\]

---

## **5. Equations of Motion**
- **Horizontal Position:**  
  \[
  x = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t
  \]
- **Vertical Position:**  
  \[
  y = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  \]

---

### **6. Key Points about Projectile Motion**
- The **horizontal velocity** remains **constant** throughout the motion.  
- The **vertical velocity** decreases while rising (due to gravity), becomes **zero at the peak**, and then increases downward.  
- The **trajectory** is a **parabola**.  
- The time to **reach max height** is \( T/2 \), and then it takes the same time to fall back.

### **7. Real-Life Examples**
- Throwing a ball  
- A bullet fired from a gun  
- A rocket or missile trajectory  
- Water coming out of a hose at an angle
