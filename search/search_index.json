It is a combination of two independent motions: Horizontal motion (constant velocity, no acceleration). Vertical motion (accelerated motion due to gravity). 1. Components of Initial Velocity When a projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) , it has two components: Horizontal velocity: [ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta ] Vertical velocity: [ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta ] At any time \\( t \\) , the velocity components are: - Horizontal velocity remains constant: [ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta ] - Vertical velocity changes due to gravity: [ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt ] where \\( g = 9.8 \\, m/s^2 \\) (acceleration due to gravity). 2. Time of Flight ( \\( T \\) ) The total time the projectile spends in the air is determined by the time taken to reach the highest point and then fall back down: [ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} ] 3. Maximum Height ( \\( H \\) ) The highest vertical position of the projectile is given by: [ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} ] 4. Horizontal Range ( \\( R \\) ) The total horizontal distance traveled by the projectile before hitting the ground is: [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} ] 5. Equations of Motion Horizontal Position: [ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t ] Vertical Position: [ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] 6. Key Points about Projectile Motion The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion. The vertical velocity decreases while rising (due to gravity), becomes zero at the peak , and then increases downward. The trajectory is a parabola . The time to reach max height is \\( T/2 \\) , and then it takes the same time to fall back. 7.
